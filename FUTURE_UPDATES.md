# Dreamlink Future Updates

## 1. Dream Journal Search System

### Phase 1: Basic Infrastructure (Backend)
1. Create database indexes on relevant columns:
   - Add text search index on dream_entries.original_text
   - Add GIN index on dream_entries.tags array
   - Add indexes on bible_citations fields

2. Implement search API endpoints:
   - `/api/search` - handles different search types (text, tags, bible refs)
   - Support for filtering, sorting, and pagination

### Phase 2: Interactive Tag-Based Search UI
1. Design and implement tag input component:
   - As users type, suggestions appear below input
   - Pressing Tab/Enter converts text to a tag pill
   - Multiple tags shown as removable pills in input
   - Support for different tag categories (symbols, emotions, themes)
   
2. Implement real-time search:
   - Search results update as tags are added/removed
   - Debounce input to prevent excessive API calls
   - Show loading states during searches

### Phase 3: Advanced Search Features
1. Add keyword highlighting in search results:
   - Highlight matching terms in dream text
   - Visual indication of which tags matched
   
2. Implement filter/sort options:

   - Sort by relevance, date, emotion intensity
   - Filter by biblical reference

3. Add saved searches feature:

   - One-click to run saved searches
   
### Phase 4: Search Analytics and Improvements
1. Track search patterns to improve suggestions:
   - Log commonly searched terms
   - Build personalized tag suggestions

2. Implement semantic search:
   - Use embeddings to find conceptually similar dreams
   - Explore patterns across dream journal

### Implementation Notes
1. Use a client-side state management solution (React Context or similar)
2. Consider implementing search as a server component with client islands
3. Cache search results for performance
4. Use proper debouncing and throttling for real-time search
5. Show "no results" states with helpful suggestions

## 2. Customizable Dream Card Size

### Feature Description
Allow users to customize the size of dream cards in their dashboard/homepage view to improve readability and personalization.

### Implementation Plan

2. UI Controls:
   - Add size controls in the top bar of the dream journal page
   - Display current size and allow toggling between options
   - Show preview of how cards will look

3. Responsive Implementation:
   - Use CSS Grid with dynamic cell sizing based on user preference
   - Adjust text truncation and content display based on card size
   - Ensure mobile compatibility with size options

4. Technical Considerations:
   - Store preference in Supabase user profiles table
   - Use client-side state (localStorage) as fallback
